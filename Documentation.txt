DOCUMENTATION:


CHANGELOG
+----------+----------+----------+

10/11/2013	Project began.  Basic GUI functionality and format.

11/10/2013	Volatility linked with GUI.  Commands implemented 
		        without flags.
		        
11/24/2013	Options added in, initial functionaility complete



VolaGUI.config File
+----------+----------+----------+

1. 	The first line of specifies where the Volatility Framework executable is located.
	  Edit this value with the full path when running VolaGUI.

2.	File has known command groups as headers to the commands
	  within that group. (CMDDLL, CMDPROCMEM, CMDKERNEL, CMDGUI, 
	  CMDNET, CMDREG, CMDMAL)

3.	Each command within each group must be in the following 
  	  format: 'COMMAND:COMMAND_DESCRIPTION:FLAGS'.
	  (modules:Print list of loaded modules:P)

4.	Exceptions to the command formats exist within the flags
	  field.  Because almost all commands use the -f and 
  	  --profile flags, these options are not included in the 
	  config file.  Instead these are hardcoded in.  Cases
	  not following this can be seen below

5.	All flags containing a single letter exist as they are in 
	  the Volatility documentation Certain commands use options 
	  such as '--offset' which are not easily dealt with in the 
	  config file.  Instead, single letters special to VolaGUI 
	  are used in the config file.  These cases can be 
	  seen below:

  	  q == --offset=
	  Q == --physical-offset=
  	  M == -max_history=
	  e == --save-evt
	  L == --LEAK
	  R == --REDR
	  X == --regex=
	  B == --base=
  	  v == --verbose
  	  * == no additinal options besides --profile and -f

6.	Ensure that volagui.config is in the same folder as VolaGUI.ps1.
